Produce a dataset of schools which satisfy all of Maria's criteria
Rank them from best to worst according to the same criteria.

Maria's schools must:
1.  be in an urban/metropolitan area.
2.  be in a city that ranks 75th percentile or higher on Kauffman's start-up rankings.
3.  be below 50th percentile in overall crime.
4.  offer a 2-year or 4-year degree in Information Technology/Science.
5.  Maria doesn't like the cold. Find and integrate temperature data. 
    Eliminate any schools located in cities/areas below the 25th percentile 
    in average temperature.
    

The plan:
1. Explore the data.
    1. Read the pdf data dictionaries or codebooks to figure out what 
    the variables mean and which ones you will need to use.
    2. Look for suitable columns to join the tables on.
    3. Load the data
    4. Explore the loaded data and eliminate the unneeded columns.
    5. Consider a metric for combined classification.
2. Data preprocessing.
    1. Perform any cleaning and standardization needed to facilitate 
       the joins & data congruency.
    2. Engineer a summary variable for school crime so that we can 
    compare schools by levels of crime overall.
3. Analysis.
    1. Eliminate from the data all the data points that fail to satisfy Maria's criteria.
    2. Engineer a summary parameter(equation) based on all the useful parameters.

"""
1.1.-1.2. Reading of data pdf documentation. Finding potentialy useful columns.

The data(parameters) that I need:
    -Area character (Metropolian/Urban)
    -City name
    -Kaufman startups ranking, city
    -Crime rate (below 50th percentile)
    -Study subject (Information Technology/Science)
    -Subject lenght of studies/type of degree (2-year or 4-year degree)
    -Yearly average temperature data

Observation: the common parameter for all these data seems to be the City name.

The pontentially useful data I can find (to explore further):
*CollegeScoreboard:
    Root
    -ID
    -Currently Operating
    About the school
    -Name
    -Location
    -Degree Type
    Acedemics
    -Programs Offered by Type
*Crime:
    Rates
*Kaufmann Index Entrepreneurship
    ent015u		entrepreneurship
    MSA Code (cities)

Observation: None of the current data sources has the temperature data. 
    I found online a publicly available dataset for 321 cities in the US
    (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities)

*Daily Temperature of Major Cities
    -City
    -AvgTemperature
